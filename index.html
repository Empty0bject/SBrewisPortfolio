				<h2>Data science and big data analytics</h2>
				<p>I am seeking a role which will allow me to apply my interest and skills in neural network development for big data analysis, where I am continuously pushed to develop in order to create effective and smart solutions. Some job titles that interest me include data scientist, deep learning engineer and ML research scientist, all of which interest me due to their work with developing and applying algorithms, processing big data in order to find patterns and developing predictive models.</p>
				<p>As AI as a whole revolves around finding relevant large data sets, skills in data analysis will be paramount. I have already begun to develop my skills in excel with courses such as Robin Hunts Introduction to Data Analysis (shown on my LinkedIn), however when developing more numeric models, a knowledge of data visualisation and manipulation tools such as GraphPadPrism and RStudio become important.</p>
				<p>I'd say the biggest gap in my knowledge would be of the standard systems used to visualise data, some examples being the java application D3.js or program Apache Spark. I believe if I am to have an advantage over my peers in the competitive job market, the best place to begin would be learning the fundamentals in data analysis using these programs.</p>
